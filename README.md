# Robi

Robi is a lighweight and simple to use management site to track software versions across different environments.

Create software along with environments and combine those two to create software assets which are then visible on a homepage. Yeah, that's hard to imagine - just check out the demo below! 

PHP for back-end, SQLite as database and pure CSS for theming magic.
